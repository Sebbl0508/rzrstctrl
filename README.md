# rzrstctrl
Example GUI app for communicating with the [rzrctrl](https://github.com/Sebbl0508/rzrst) kernel module for setting sidetone volume and state(ON/OFF) for the "Razer USB Sound Card".

## WIP
This is currently work-in-progress, since the `rzrctrl` module isn't ready for general use at the moment either.
